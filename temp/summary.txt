
In Civil Petition No. 46054 <span class='highlight'>of 2024</span>, the Supreme Court of Pakistan addressed the authority of the Punjab Government to appoint teaching faculty at the University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore, under the KEMU Act <span class='highlight'>of 2005</span>. The petitioner Dr. Nakshab Chaudhry, the Dean of Basic Medical Sciences and Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry, challenged the authority of KEMU, which was established as a quasi-autonomous institution and later reconstituted as a fully-autonomous institution.The petitioner argued that the Punjab Government lacked the authority to make such appointments under the KEMU Act, stating that the university was established as a "Syndicate" and had no authority to make such appointments. The Punjab Government has consistently appointed candidates from outside the jurisdiction of the relevant selection board, asserting that these appointments must comply with the KEMU Act.The petitioner also highlighted that the university was not bound by its own rules and regulations, as the appointments were made by the Punjab Government, not the KEMU Act or its Rul es. The court found that the Punjab Government could not interfere with the appointments made by the Punjab Government, as it did not follow the relevant legal rules. Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the appointments under the KEMU Act and its provisions, and stated that the Punjab Government's role in the matter was limited to transferring appointments to other universities. The court concluded that there was no legal bar under <span class='highlight'>Article 199</span> of the Constitution, and the petition was dismissed.
